      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am an experienced maths tutor based in Chinnor, Oxfordshire, working
        with all ages up to GCSE higher, with good results.</p>
      <p>A graduate in mathematics from Oxford University, I spent many years as
          an airline pilot before starting a family and returning to my favourite school subject.
          I thoroughly enjoy helping people feel more confident in maths - I'm
          saddened when people say they can’t do it, as I strongly believe that
          with a little help and encouragement they absolutely can!</p>

            <p>"I used Jenny’s services for both my children for their GCSE’s.
              She’s an amazing teacher, she gave the confidence back to my
              children and they were then both capable of passing/excelling in
              their exams. Jenny is very professional and always kept me up to
              date with both of their progress. I am very happy to recommend her."

            <p> "I found Jenny to be a wonderful and patient teacher who helped me
              understand things with easier routes than school teachers ever did.
              She has boosted my confidence in approaching certain questions and
              being calmer in a test. She gave me lots of material to revise with,
              an overall very useful teacher. I would be happy to
              refer/recommend her."</p>

            <p> "Jenny is a really brilliant tutor, she really helped build my
              confidence with the topics which I wasn’t so confident in.
              This pushed me further throughout the subject, really helping me to
               raise my GCSE grade.  Each week I left the lesson gaining more
               knowledge and confidence.  She was friendly and encouraging."</p>

      <h3>Study Options</h3>
      <p>I usually teach pupils once a week, although sometimes I'm asked for
        more as exams approach. If you prefer a different arrangement I will do
        my best to accommodate.</p>
