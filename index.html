      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am an experienced maths tutor based in Chinnor, Oxfordshire, working
        with all ages up to GCSE higher, with good results.</p>
      <p>A graduate in mathematics from Oxford University, I spent many years as
          an airline pilot before starting a family and returning to my favourite school subject.
          I thoroughly enjoy helping people feel more confident in maths - I'm
          saddened when people say they can’t do it, as I strongly believe that
          with a little help and encouragement they absolutely can!</p>
